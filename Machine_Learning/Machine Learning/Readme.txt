Please download the files and place the CSV-files in the same folder as the Classification example files.

MachineLearning.m is the main script that needs to be executed. You can execute this script section-by-section. 
It demostrates the use of different machine learning techniques for a classification problem.

This script makes use of the full data set available in bank-full.csv. 
One could make use of the smaller data set available in bank.csv as one prototypes their code. One may change the call to ImportBankData and provide the other file name as input.
