# incremental_learning_extension
Extending the base incremental learning algorithm with some new functionalities

The previous version: incremental_learning was for running the experiminets with NIPS

-This extensions refactors the code such that the online learning is independent from the experimental setup
-Also input arguments to the algorithms are reduced
-I believe I fixed the balanced version
